# Section A Review, Option 1

 - Correctness

Your program creates a class Solution which necessitates the creation of an object in order to use the method groupAnagrams. Only the function needs to be defined and can then be called in your code. The code does not unfortunately execute wihtout errors.

 - Styling

Indentation is very important as it is how the program is interpreted by the computer. While your for loop, line 4 to 9 is correctly indented, line 2 is not.

 - Efficiency

A 2D array is an array which has other arrays at each of its indexes and it might be worthwhile to make use of a 2D array instead of a Dictionary

In line 5 you are calling the function sorted, but you are not passing it any parameters. The list of strings also do not need to be sorted 

Your function requires two variables, however only one is used. When calling the function in line 12, self is the only variable which is assigned data.

 - Documentation

 Including comments using a # symbol makes it easier for other developers to understand your thinking process when creating your own functions.  


 - Overall feedback

 It is a good first attempt, however there are a few things to look at: try to not unecessarily complicate the code, look at 2D arrays and add comments to your code.
